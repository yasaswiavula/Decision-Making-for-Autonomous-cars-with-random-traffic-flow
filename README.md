# Decision-Making-for-Autonomous-cars-with-random-traffic-flow
From the beginning of manufacturing the Autonomous vehicles, it is famously considered to meet the need for driverless cars in urban settings. Now to widen the horizon and bring the use of driverless cars to all environment settings, we need our Autonomous cars to be able to drive safely even in a single line setting or in a lane-less setting. One of the most difficult aspects of properly running autonomous cars in this kind of sub-urban areas is correctly determining the status of other participants while keeping safety and efficiency in mind. We would like to propose a probabilistic decision-making technique that may be employed in a random traffic scenario while also considering safety, efficiency, and comfort. The driving task was first formulated as the Markov decision process (MDP) by defining the environment state space, agent action space.
